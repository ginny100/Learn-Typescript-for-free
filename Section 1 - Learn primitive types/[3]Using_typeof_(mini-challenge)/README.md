# Using typeof (mini-challenge)
- A mini project used to complete the mini challenge
- Look at the `index.html` file, you'll see the `input` fields. Whatever we put in there in the form from the UI, and then access it with `JavaScript`, we'll get values of type `String`
- A solution using `Vanilla JavaScript` is to use `typeof` as indicated in the `index.js` file.
